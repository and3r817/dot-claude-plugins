# Android Kotlin Compose Skill

Expert guidance for Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose with modern architecture patterns.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add and3r817/dot-claude-plugins
/plugin install android-kotlin-compose@dot-claude-plugins
```

## What It Does

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for Android development:

- **Compose UI**: Declarative UI patterns, state hoisting, side effects
- **MVVM Architecture**: ViewModel, StateFlow, unidirectional data flow
- **Jetpack Libraries**: Navigation, Room, Hilt, WorkManager integration
- **Material3**: Theming, dynamic colors, component patterns

## Example Usage

Ask Claude:

- "How do I implement a search screen with Compose?"
- "Set up Room database with Hilt injection"
- "Create a navigation graph with type-safe arguments"
- "Implement pull-to-refresh with proper state management"
